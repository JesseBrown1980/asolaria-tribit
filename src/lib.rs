//! tribit — three zeros, carried on AC, and the rainbow light hose.
//!
//! # Why DC cannot do this
//!
//! Direct current has no zero crossing. It has one direction and therefore two states,
//! and that is the whole reason the binary world is binary — not a design choice, a
//! property of the carrier.
//!
//! Alternating current crosses zero **twice per cycle, in opposite directions**. Rising
//! through zero and falling through zero are both exactly zero volts and are not the
//! same event. Add the quiescent line and there are three:
//!
//! ```text
//!        +           /‾\           /‾\
//!                   /   \         /   \
//!     0  ----------X-----X-------X-----X----------   Nil : the line is dead
//!                 /       \     /       \
//!        -      \_/         \_/           Pos : crossing upward
//!                                         Neg : crossing downward
//! ```
//!
//! **Correction, 2026-10-08 (recorded beside the law, not over it).** The three zeros above are
//! real: the `Zero` type carries all three and `rotate`/`anti_rotate` turn them in an order-3 orbit
//! (R³ = identity, R ≠ R²). But `Carrier::zero_at` **cannot reach the third** — measured
//! exhaustively over `steps_per_cycle` in `1..=64` and every phase, `Some(Zero::Nil)` occurred
//! **0 times**. A crossing is never a dead line, so AC reaches `{Pos, Neg}` and DC reaches `{Nil}`.
//! `zero_states()` previously returned 3 and disagreed with the behaviour on 63 of 64 cycle lengths;
//! it now reports reachability. The three are measured in the **rainbow lane** instead — RAINBOR's
//! three waves (`path1.path2.path3` = NN · GNN · FNN, each an HTTP-0 portal acting as itself), where
//! the anti is order-3 at **192 of 192** and the free fourth zero is the point at which the three
//! waves agree. The carrier was the wrong instrument, not a broken law.
//!
//! All three have **magnitude zero**. `Zero::magnitude()` returns 0 for every variant and
//! that is not a stub. The information is not in the value, it is in *which zero* — the
//! direction of travel through it. That is why all three are free: Law 0 makes the centre
//! the fixed point of {N, R, R²}, the one point that moves under neither inversion nor
//! anti-inversion, so it costs nothing to hold. Three free states instead of two paid ones.
//!
//! # The registers
//!
//! Book IX (IX.B.3) numbers five, and the numbering is load-bearing:
//!
//! | n | register | cost |
//! |---|------------|------|
//! | 0 | zero        | free, never computed |
//! | 1 | translucent | free, never computed — **this is light itself** |
//! | 2 | red         | costs |
//! | 3 | green       | costs |
//! | 4 | blue        | costs |
//!
//! Law 32 is titled *"Translucent is One, Not Zero"*. Pure 1 is light before a prism has
//! split it; 2, 3 and 4 are what the prism makes of it. That is why 1 is free and 2..4 are
//! not — undifferentiated light carries no colour decision, and a decision is what costs.
//!
//! # The hose
//!
//! Law 31, the rainbow lighthouse drill, is a conduit and its traversal order is fixed:
//! translucent tip → red → green → blue → translucent tail. The tip is measured (Law 30,
//! mean 0.4013 bpb saved by ordering translucent first). **The tail is not measured** and
//! is marked as such here rather than assumed symmetric.
//!
//! # Integer only
//!
//! Law 34's build directive: *"rust 1.81 int and float possible. int works way better in
//! my opinion."* Nothing below uses a float. The transform is a Number-Theoretic Transform
//! over `Z/pZ`, so split→recombine is exact rather than nearly exact, and `no_std` holds.
